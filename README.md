# Laptop-Price-Prediction-using-regression-techniques
## Objective:
The objective of this machine learning project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of laptops based on various features and specifications. By training the model on historical laptop data, we aim to develop a reliable tool that can assist both buyers and sellers in determining fair and competitive prices for different laptop configurations.
